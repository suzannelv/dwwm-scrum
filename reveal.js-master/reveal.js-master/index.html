							<h2>3. The Scrum Events</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Events that create regularity and minimize other meetings.
								</li>
								<li>
									The Sprint is a container for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.
								</li>
							</ul>
						 </section>

						 <!-- Sprint -->
						 <section>
							<h3>3.1 What is a Sprint?</h3>
							<p>Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value. The Sprint is the Scrum event that encompasses all of the other Scrum events.</p>
							<p>They are fixed length periods of work that last one month or less to create consistency and ensure short iterations for feedback in order to inspect and adapt both how work is done and what is being worked on.</p>
							<p>
								All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.
							</p>
						 </section>
						 <!-- product goal -->
						 <section>
							<p>
								Sprints enable predictability by ensuring that the Scrum Team inspects and adapts toward the Product Goal and Sprint Goal each Sprint:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>
									<h4>Product Goal:</h4>
									<p>The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define ‚Äúwhat‚Äù will fulfill the Product Goal. The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						 </section>
						 <!-- sprint goal -->
						 <section>
							<ul>
								<li>Sprint Goal:</li>
								<p>
									The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.
								</p>
							</ul>

						 </section>
						 <section>
							<strong>Empiricism</strong>is the most important practice for you and your Scrum Team to embrace during the Sprint. There is a lot unknown in complex environments. By embracing empiricism your team will learn by doing and will continue to improve as you navigate complex work. 
						 </section>
						 <!-- Sprint Planning -->
						 <section>
							<h3>3.2 What is Sprint Planning?</h3>
							<p>Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.</p>
						 </section>
						 <section>
							<h3>Sprint Planning has three topics:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<h4>Topic one:Why is this Sprint valuable?</h4>
									<p>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						 </section>
						 <section>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<h4>Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?</h4>
									<p>Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.
									</p>
									<p>
										Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						 </section>
						 <section>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<h4>Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?</h4>
									<p>For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						 </section>
              <!-- Daily Scrum -->
						 <section>
							<h3>3.3 What is a Daily Scrum?</h3>
							<p>
								The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
							</p>
						 </section>
						 <section>
							<ul>
								<li>Inspection and Adaption at the Heart of Scrum.</li>
								<li>The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting happens, but the Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches them to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.</li>
								<li>The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Scrum Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.</li>
							</ul>
						 </section>

						 <!-- Sprint Review -->
						 <section>
							<h3>3.4 What is a Sprint Review?</h3>
							<p>
								the purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
							</p>
						 </section>
						 <section>
							The Sprint Review may include the following elements and more:
							  <ul>
									<li>
                    Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
									</li>
									<li>
										Members of the Scrum Team explain what Product Backlog items have been ‚ÄúDone‚Äù and what has not been ‚ÄúDone‚Äù;
									</li>
									<li>
										The Developers discuss what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;											
									</li>
									<li>
										The Developers demonstrate the work that it has ‚ÄúDone‚Äù and answers questions about the Increment;
									</li>
									<li>
										The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
									</li>
								</ul>
						 </section>
						 <section>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
								</li>
								<li>
									Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next;
								</li>
								<li>
									Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality and capability of the product.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>->The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.</p>
						 </section>
						 <!-- Sprint retropective -->
						 <section>
							<h3>3.5 What is a Sprint Retropective?</h3>
						  <p>the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
							</p>

						 </section>
						 <section>
							During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:
							<ul>
								<li>What went well in the Sprint</li>
									<li>What could be improved</li>
									<li>What will we commit to</li>
							</ul>
							<p>-> Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.</p>

						<h2>4. The Scrum Artifacts</h2>
						<p>
							Scrum‚Äôs artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.</li>
							<li>For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.</li>
							<li>For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.</li>
						</ul>	
					</section>
					<!-- Product Backlog -->
					<section>
						<h3>4.1 What is a Product Backlog?</h3>
						<p>The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Product Backlog Refinement</h4>
						<p>Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. </p>
						<p>
							Refinement is not mandatory, however it is a good practice to consider in order to increase transparency and make work items more precise.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Commitment:  Product Goal</h4>
						<p>The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define ‚Äúwhat‚Äù will fulfill the Product Goal.</p>
					</section>

					<!-- Product Goal -->
					<section>
						<h3>4.2 What is a Product Goal?</h3>
						<p>the Product Goal provides context to the Product Backlog. The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. </p>
						<p>
							The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team.  
						</p>
						<p>
							The Product Goal is a simple directional statement that provides context and purpose (of the work) for the Scrum Team and its stakeholders. 
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- Sprint Backlog -->
					<section>
						<h3>4.3 What is a Sprint Backlog?</h3>
						<p>
							The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).
						</p>
						<p>
							The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.
						</p>
						<img src="https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/inline-images/2017-03/SprintBacklog_0.png" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>4.4 What is a Sprint Goal?</h3>
						<p>The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates cohesiveness and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.</p>
				   	<p>The Sprint Goal is created during Sprint Planning by the Scrum Team and then added to the Sprint Backlog. </p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Sprint Goal Characteristics</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The goal must be attainable and not too large or it will have the opposite impact.
							</li>
							<li>
								It is also important for the Sprint Goal to be visible so that the Scrum Team does not lose sight of it.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>4.5 What is an Increment?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
							</li>
							<li>
								Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>4.6 What is a Definition of Done?</h3>
						<p>
							The Definition of Done describes the quality standards for the Increment. Learn why getting to Done is so important, what undone work is, if it‚Äôs okay to show work that isn‚Äôt done to stakeholders, can you present undone work at the Sprint Review and what‚Äôs the difference between the DoD and Definition of Ready or acceptance criteria.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once all of the items in the Definition of Done are checked off and complete, this Increment is considered Done.
